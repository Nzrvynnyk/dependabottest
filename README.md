## Credit Where Credit Is Due

This template was adapted from the very excellent 
[Vitesse template on GitHub](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse). created by [antfu](https://github.com/antfu) to whom I am grateful. The work done there gave me a wonderfully thought out starting point for my own remixes, which is entirely in line with the dev philosophy WE actively embrace with MyriaD.

## i18n Removal
When we cloned the original [Vitesse template on GitHub](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse). created by [antfu](https://github.com/antfu), i18n was part of it, but outside the scope of what we are using it for. 

We wanted pretty much all of the other features that were missing from the lite version, so we opted to stay with the main version and just remove the i18n usages.

We are leaving the packages in for anyone that wants to come along and port things to other languages, but at this time its not feasible, for that reason all usages are being removed from the code

## Docker Support Removed

We don't use Docker, and are not supporting it at this time with this template, any lingering files feels free to submit an issue to remove but We will need to make sure nothing breaks when we do so, so I'm leaving everything as is for now.
