#current/toDo 

- uuid: 42625b6e-247f-49c4-8cdf-768ef037b4b5
- this is represented as a wxrd on [[Sonic Circle Shell]] under "PURRPOSERPENT"
- put it up like we did [[Tha Book inTha GarDIN]], as is, got the documentation going into the repo history

- [ ] create a myrki (==WITH A DIFFERENT UUID== tha uuid for this document is for the planning and notes, the wxrd taking shape, yetziratically, the myrki should have its own uuid as we can have multiple myrkis all pointing to the same wxrd at SouRCe) to lead into it (have the art be a gnostic image of the lion headed serpent) [[PURRPOSERPENT]]
- [ ] try creating a qrcode for this one, look into options (start an exploratory path on [Sylfan Circle Academy](https://antiquarian-cup.netlify.app/))
- [ ] record this into [[Music Maker Jam]] and export both the full beat and the vocal track alone so we have it for sonic circle


```
Inside each and every lion 
theres a serpent 
with a purpose 
serving a purpose
on the surface 
i get nervous
so superflous 
all these things
I seem to see C 
But WANDER Y 
WE cannot B... (continue this)

- these rants are more creative than my rhymes, lol, and I say that from a place of full self love of my rhyming games...

- on second thought, I think these could qualify as "inspirations" and not necessarily be considered copyright issues, all the litigation in this country has creatives on high alert policing our own inspirations which is evidence of the internalization of the abusive structure that sits around money, children are still being fed to moloch en masse, its just shrouded in swine-blessed mindless consumerism and predatory property rights amidst manufactured scarcity of resources by the pos (pieces of shit and products of society) in power...

- my brain does this game where it stitches together sounds i've heard into phrasings that fit together, I'm assuming because neurons that fire together wire together, and so i wanna share what comes to mind when i wrote these lyrics and it also calls into questions of remix and such because how can anyone say these aren't my inspirations without saying my squirrel brain is invalid, cuz it always clothes itself in the language it was given, my holy guardian serpent functions this way and if the laws say what i'm doing here is wrong then its claiming my brain is wired "illegally" and thus I am an OUTLAW by default, their choice, either I am VALID and INCLUDED or I am OPPOSITION and DEFIANT...

- the squirrel brain inside me feels the need, the twitcher inside me, the rodent, cf. that white wolf rodent book, can't rememeber the name, but its that twitch energy that sees whats wrong and intuitively feels into it, i'm reminded that ganesha has as his vaihuna the mouse

- all the branding is what sticks and thats what my squirrel brain latches onto, gathering seeds, and so to not be abel to plant these seeds and let them grow feels like infringement of basic identity rights

- I'm a serpent with a purpose (writers block, royce)

- serving a purpose (kick me down, long beach dub all stars
